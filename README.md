# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    _Big O describes how long an algorithm will take to run in a worst case scenario_

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    _Big O measures the time and complexity of a function_

---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    _b._

---



4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   _Binary search_

---


5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    _O(log n)_

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

  _O(1) has set inputs and the time will never change, O(n) has variable input and time will linearly reflect inputs, and O(n^2) will grow exponentially with inputs._

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    _A function whose big O followed O(log n) would have one continuously shrinking computational feature, such as a recursion. A function whose big O followed O(n log n) would have a both a shrinking computational feature and a computational feature whose input would vary in size._
